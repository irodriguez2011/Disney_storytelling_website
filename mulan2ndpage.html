             <p> Mulan was not alone on her journey. A dragon named Mushu, sent from the Ancestors to be her guardian, and a cricket named Cri-Kee were always at her side.
            Working together, they wrote a fake letter ordering Shang and his soldiers to go after the Huns. Now Mulan would get her chance to bring honor to her family.
            Heeding the letter's message, Shang led his soldiers into the mountains. Suddenly, they were surrounded by thousands of Huns. Mulan got an idea.
            She grabbed the very last cannon and, using Mushu's flame, lit the fuse. The cannon caused a massive avalanche of snow to fall on the Huns.
            But the danger wasn't over. Snow was now racing toward Mulan and her friends.

       <div id="secondPara"> <p>Mulan's loyal horse, Khan, ran to her side. She jumped onto his back, and just as the snow was about to bury Shang, Mulan pulled him to safety.
            During the battle, Mulan had been injured. While caring for her wound, a medic realized that "Ping" was a woman. Shang had no choice but to leave Mulan behind.
            As she sat with Khan, Mushu, and Cri-Kee, Mulan felt she had failed her family and herself. Then she heard the Huns' voices.
            Mulan raced to the Imperial City to warn Shang. "The Huns are alive!" she told him. "They're in the city."
            But Shang felt betrayed by Mulan and did not trust her. Mulan tried warning the others, but no one would believe her.</p>

        <div id="thirdPara"> <p>The Hun leader, Shan-Yu, kidnapped the Emperor, but Mulan and Shang rescued him. Furious, Shan-Yu chased Mulan onto the palace roof - exactly as she planned.
            Mulan grabbed Shan-Yu's sword and pinned his coat to the roof. He couldn't move when Mushu and Cri-Kee shot a rocket his way.
            The force of the explosion sent Mushu and Cri-Kee flying through the air. Mulan and Shang fell together to the ground as fireworks began to fill the sky. </p> </div>

            The people were celebrating. The Huns had been banished, and the Imperial City was safe!
            The Emperor was very grateful to Mulan. "You have saved us all," he said, and then he did something extraordinary: The Emperor bowed to Mulan.
            Everyone in the plaza bowed to Mulan, too. The Emperor asked her to stay on as his adviser, but Mulan knew it was time to return to her family.
            At home, Mulan presented her father with a sword given to her by the Emperor.
            
            <p id="dadQuote">"The greatest gift and honor is having you for a daughter," her father said. "I've missed you so."</p> </p></div>
