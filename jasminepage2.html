   <p>At the entrance, the old man wouldn't help them. He was really the Sultan's evil assistant, Jafar!
                Though stuck in the Cave, Abu had tricked Jafar and kept the magic lamp for Aladdin.
                When Aladdin rubbed it, a genie whirled out of the lamp to rescue them from the Cave and to grant Aladdin three wishes!
                Aladdin's first wish was to be a prince. Disguised as a wealthy prince visiting from another kingdom, Aladdin went to see Princess Jasmine once again.
                That night, Aladdin took Jasmine on a magic carpet ride that they would never forget.
                Flying over deserts, mountains, and seas, Jasmine and Aladdin discovered a whole new world.
                The wonder and magic of the night brought them closer together. They were falling in love.
                "Good night, my handsome prince," whispered Jasmine at the end of their flight.
                Then Aladdin kissed her. Aladdin was so happy, he felt as if he was floating on air.</p>

        But Jafar had an evil plan. He ordered his guards to throw Aladdin into the sea.
        Aladdin used his second wish to have the Genie rescue him. But then Jafar stole the magic lamp!
        Now the Genie had to serve Jafar! And the wicked sorcerer was holding Jasmine prisoner!
        As Aladdin sneaked into the palace to save her, Jasmine used her charms to distract Jafar.

        Aladdin tricked Jafar into using one of his wishes. "I wish to be an all-powerful genie!" proclaimed Jafar.
        He became an evil genie, and Aladdin trapped him inside a magic lamp for all time!
        The Sultan told Jasmine that she could marry whomever she chose. Princess Jasmine chose to marry her one true loveâ€”Aladdin!
        Aladdin used his final wish to free the Genie forever. In a flash, the Genie dressed to travel the world.
