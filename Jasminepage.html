        <div id="firstParagraph"><p> Deep in the Arabian Desert, Princess Jasmine lived with her father, the Sultan of Agrabah, and her tiger, Rajah.The Sultan had said Jasmine must marry a princeâ€”and soon. 
            But Jasmine wanted to marry for love, not just to make her father happy!
            In a nearby village, there lived a young man named Aladdin.
             His best friend was a monkey he called Abu.
            Aladdin was poor, but he had big dreams. "Someday," he told Abu, "we will live in a palace!"
            Jasmine refused to be married. So she disguised herself as a peasant and left home.
            In the marketplace, she accidentally stole an apple. A guard grabbed Jasmine, but Aladdin stepped in to protect her. 
            Aladdin took Jasmine to his home. As they talked, they discovered they each dreamed of living a life different than their own.</p></div>

            
            <p id="centerParagraph">"I ran away, and I am not going back," said Jasmine.</p>

            
           <p>Then the palace guards burst in and seized Aladdin! Jasmine revealed herself as the princess and demanded Aladdin be freed.<a href="jasminepage2.html">  <img src="jasmine story pictures/jasmin peasant.JPG" class="jasminePeasant" width=400 height=181/></a> 
                To her shock, the guards refused. Aladdin was taken away.

                

                While locked in the palace dungeon, Aladdin met an old man who helped him escape.
                The man took Aladdin and Abu to the Cave of Wonders. He wanted Aladdin to retrieve a magic lamp hidden inside.
                Aladdin and Abu found the lamp and a magic carpet! But as they left, the Cave began to rumble and shake and turn into molten lava!</p>
