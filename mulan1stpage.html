            <div id="firstParagraph"> <p> Mulan's father had once been a great warrior, but his leg had been injured in battle. As an only child, Mulan felt responsible for upholding the family honor.
                One day, a man arrived with terrible news from the Emperor. The Huns, China's enemy, had invaded.
                The Emperor had ordered that one man from every family must join the Imperial Army. Mulan's aging father had to fight...again.
                
                Mulan knew her father was too old to fight. Late that night, she made a big decision.
                After saying a prayer to the Ancestors, she used a sword to cut her hair short. Then she put on her father's warrior clothes.
                As her parents slept, Mulan, now dressed as a young man, jumped onto her father's horse, Khan.

            <div id="secondPara"> <p>When Mulan arrived at the Imperial Army's training camp, she met Captain Li Shang. "What is your name?" he asked Mulan.
                "My name? It's, uh...Ping!" Mulan said. To her amazement, Shang and the other soldiers believed she was a man!
                Shang worked hard to teach his soldiers strength and discipline. Mulan struggled to keep up. Frustrated, Shang told her to go home.
                But to earn the soldiers' respect, Mulan retrieved an arrow atop a tall pole. This was the hardest training task of all, and Mulan had done it! </p> </div>

<div id="thirdPara"><p>Mulan was not alone on her journey. A dragon named Mushu, sent from the Ancestors to be her guardian, and a cricket named Cri-Kee were always at her side.
    Working together, they wrote a fake letter ordering Shang and his soldiers to go after the Huns. Now Mulan would get her chance to bring honor to her family.
    Heeding the letter's message, Shang led his soldiers into the mountains. Suddenly, they were surrounded by thousands of Huns. Mulan got an idea. </p></div>
