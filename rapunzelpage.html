             <p>  What her devoted parents didn’t know was that Rapunzel’s golden hair contained magical healing powers.
                A selfish old woman named Mother Gothel knew of the magic in Rapunzel’s hair and wanted it to keep herself young.
                So she kidnapped the baby and raised her in a tower deep in the woods, never telling her that she was a princess.
                As Rapunzel’s hair grew and grew, she loved gazing out the tower window at the lights that floated in the night sky every year on her birthday.
